<h2>Overview of indexed databanks</h2>

<p>When you click on the link in the top left corner of the window you will be presented with a page containing an overview of the indexed databanks on this site. The list contains three columns, the name, the ID and the number of entries in this databank.</p>

<p>You can click on the name of a databank and this will bring you to a new page containing statistics about this databank. You will notice that for some databanks (e.g. EMBL) there are two or more files listed. For each file the size, number of records and creation date is displayed.</p>

<p>Other information you can find on this page is a list of indices for the files, this list contains the code for the index (which you can use in <a href="?page=5">queries</a>), the human readable name (if known) and the number of keys in this index.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting for the more curious among you is that you can find links here to the webpage containing more information about the databank and there are links to the parser and formatter scripts used by MRS to create and display this databank.</p>
