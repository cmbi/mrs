    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>This is MRS, a search engine for biological and medical databanks.
    Use it to search well over a terabyte of indexed text.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>Usage of MRS should be straightforward. Just type some search terms in the search field at the top of the 
    window and hit the Search button. More complex queries can be used as well.

    <!--, see the <a href="help">manual</a>for more information-->
    </p>

    <h2>New version 6</h2>

    <p>MRS 6, or M6, is a complete rewrite of MRS.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>

    <p>MRS was designed and implemented by Maarten Hekkelman at the
    CMBI with the help and contributions from many others.
    Version 6 is distributed under a Boost license. You can find the source code
    for this version at

    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>The biological data explosion of the
    'omics' era requires fast access to many data types in rapidly
    growing data banks. The MRS software provides the tools to
    rapidly and reliably download, store, index, and query
    flat-file databanks. Data stored and indexed by MRS takes
    considerably less space on disk than the raw data, despite that
    these raw data are included. The MRS index information is part
    of the stored data. Therefore, public and private data can be
    combined by simple concatenation and thus without computational
    overheads.
