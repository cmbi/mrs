<h2>The results</h2>

<p>If you selected 'All Databanks' in the popup the result of a search will be an overview
of hits grouped by databank. You can sort the results here by relevance or by databank by
clicking either of these in the bar on top of the list. The number of hits to show per databank can be chosen as well.</p>

<p>In the overview you can either click a hit to see it directly, or click one of the databank names and this will repeat the search in that particular databank only, just like you would have selected that databank from the popup menu when doing the search.</p>

<h3>The results per databank list</h3>

<p>The page you will see when doing a search in one databank only has several features that can help you to interpret the data. First of all there is a list containing four columns: one with the ID for each hit, a checkbox, a small image indicating the relevance and finally short description. The relevance image is shown only when relevant, i.e. if you did a pure boolean query there is no way a relevance ranking can be calculated and hence it is ommitted.</p>
