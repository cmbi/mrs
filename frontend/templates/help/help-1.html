<h2>Basic searching with MRS</h2>

<h3>Simple searches</h3>

<p>To do a simple search with MRS you enter a few words in the text box at the top of
the window and press Enter or click the Search button. MRS will then scan through all
indexed databanks and displays an overview of hits.</p>

<h3>Case insensitive searches</h3>

<p>Searches are done case insensitive. That means that upper and lowercase is ignored,
searches for <code>Lysozyme</code>, <code>lysozyme</code> and <code>LYSOZYME</code>
all yield the same results.</p>

<h3>Wildcards</h3>

<p>MRS indexes are exact, MRS does not use stemming. That means that searches for
<code>lysozyme</code> and <code>lysozymes</code> yield different results. However,
MRS does support <a href="?page=2">wildcards</a>. If you would
have searched for <code>lysozyme*</code> you would have found all records containing
words that <em>begin</em> with lysozyme.</p>

<h3>Implicit AND</h3>

<p>MRS uses an implicit AND for multiple search terms, i.e. the more search terms you
enter the narrower the result set since all terms must appear in a records to generate
a hit. <a href="?page=4">Boolean operators</a> are also available.</p>

<p>However, if you entered more than one search term and there were no hits, MRS relaxes
the requirement for all terms and displays the records that best matches your query terms.
