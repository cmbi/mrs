<h2>Design overview</h2>

<p>If you're responsible for keeping up-to-date a BioInformatics data
repository you're faced with quite a challenge. Not only do you have to
keep track of changing download areas and filenames, you have to cope
with ever changing file formats as well. This quickly becomes a nightmare.</p>

<p>MRS was designed to make the life of a datamanager bearable. In order to
do so we have to separate the process into several tasks, identify the
problems that can occur in each of them and try to find a way in which we
can elliminate this problem.</p>

<p>The steps we can identify are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mirroring remote data files using rsync or FTP</li>
	<li>Optionally converting these data files to make the data available
	to our indexing and retrieval system.</li>
	<li>Indexing these data files</li>
	<li>Provide a way to search these data files using these indices</li>
	<li>Present the data to the end user in a friendly way</li>
</ul>

<p>MRS tries to offer a solution for the common errors that can occur in
each of these steps. We'll discuss them here.</p>

<p>The mirroring of data in MRS is not yet described here, it will follow later on.</p>

<!--
<p>In the ideal world a datamanager can put one line into a crontab
and never look back. The data will always be fetched, converted and indexed
automatically. MRS comes close. It uses a set of makefiles to achieve the
automatic update and indexing. Makefiles are some kind of script files that
in combination with the application make (GNU make in our case) can build
dependancy graphs. (In plain English this means that a makefile can state that
file B depends on A and that means that if A is newer than B we have to do
something to update B.)</p>

<p>The first step we want our makefile to do after making sure we have all
the directories

<h3>MRS data files</h3>

<p>One of the problems we can find ourselves in is that the index is out of date.
This can happen when we download a new set of datafiles. Unpack these files by
overwriting the old ones and then start the indexing tool. From the moment you
unpack the first data file until the indexing is done you have a stale index
that points to the wrong location.</p>

<p>This can be avoided by indexing an offline copy of the data. But that also
means you need to have the diskspace to retain two uncompressed copies of the data.
With databanks like EMBL this is becomming quite a problem for many. After indexing
you also have to carefully update the links to the new data and index files.</p>

<p>And now that we're on this topic, why should we have all that data uncompressed
on our disks? It's a huge waste of capacity.</p>

<p>To avoid these problems altogether MRS puts an entire databank including its
indices into one file. MRS also compresses the data to reduce diskspace requirements.
The creation of MRS files happens offline and once the file is finished you only
have to replace the old file with the new file to atomically change versions.
The risk of putting a halfway finished index online is completely eliminated this way.</p>

<p>Another advantage to this approach is that you can use one computer for the indexing
while others provide access to the content. MRS files are endian neutral and location
independant, that means you can use the files on practically all platforms.</p>

<h3>MRS parsers</h3>

<p>The early development versions of MRS used a custom made script language. The
disadvantage of this approach quickly became apparent. It is difficult to create a
fast and still powerful language interpreter and worse, a new language needs a new
manual to describe it to explain all its features to others. Why not use a script
language many BioInformaticians are comfortable with?</p>

<p>So MRS was rewritten to become a Perl plugin. To make things easier a wrapper script
was written to drive the whole process of creating a new databank. Plugin scripts
can be written to provide parsers for all the available databanks.</p>

<p>A great deal of effort was put into creating fault tolerant parser scripts. Nothing
is as frustrating to see your parser crash because a new species has been added to 
the foobar databank and the script doesn't know how to handle it. MRS parsers can
create new indices on the fly if new fields are added to the databank structure.</p>

<h3>The web interface</h3>

<p>The web interface for MRS is just one of the ways to use MRS datafiles. Nothing
prevents you from using the MRS plugin in other scripts and in fact, we've already
created other tools this way.</p>

<p>But a web interface is what people want. And preferably a good one, an easy one.
One exceptionally good interface offering similar functionality is Google. It contains
one edit box, two buttons and a couple of links. And why would you need more? MRS
tries to mimic this minimalistic approach.</p>
